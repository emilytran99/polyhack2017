    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class= "article">
      <p>Music Map is a new way to find music. It allows users to pinpoint a state in the US and find various artists native to that state. Once selected, the artists' top songs are displayed. The user is able to click on the song of their choice and will be redirected to a link with that song.</p>

    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>Music Map was created by four freshmans at Tufts University. This webapp was our idea at the 2017 PolyHack event at Tufts. Most of us at the time of this event were beginners; with very little experience in making a webapp. </p>
